The RCC's "playbook" for successful project management.

Feedback and suggestions are welcome via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/rcc-uchicago/playbook/issues). You may also propose changes to the content directly by submitting a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request "More Information on Submitting Pull Requests").  Note that you can use GitHub's in-browser editor to edit files and submit a "pull request" for your changes to be merged into the document. 


## Technical Details

The playbook is compiled from [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown "Link to More Information About Markdown") files using [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll "Link to More Information about Jekyll"). 

To run the site locally on your own computer (most helpful for previewing your own changes), you will need to install Jekyll and other dependencies:

If you don't already have Ruby and Bundler installed, follow [the first two steps in these Jekyll installation instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages#installing-jekyll "Installation instructions for Jekyll").

Next, [fork this repository](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/ "Instructions for Forking Your Repository") and clone it on your computer.

Navigate to the folder on your computer, and run the command `$ bundle install` at the command line prompt.

To run the site locally, run `jekyll serve --watch`, then visit `http://localhost:4000/` in your browser to preview the site.
